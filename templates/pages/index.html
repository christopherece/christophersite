            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Greetings! <br>

                I am an experienced Technical Engineer with a strong background in IT support and over 10+ years of experience in the information technology and services industry. I excel in providing top-notch technical support for both hardware and software issues, both onsite and remotely. <br>
                Throughout my IT career, I have developed additional skills. I have acquired knowledge in virtualization using Proxmox, Ansible for configuring systems, deploy software and system updates to provide custom solutions and automate tasks. I also have hands-on experience with Docker. Leveraging Docker, I have improved development workflows, 
                simplified application deployment, and ensured software portability across different environments. <br>
                Furthermore, I possess programming skills in Django, Laravel and JS, combine with SQL Database allowing me to develop web applications. I have used programming to create scripts, develop small-scale applications, and integrate Docker into larger software solutions. <br>
                With my expertise in IT support, virtualization using Proxmox, Ansible, Docker experience, and programming skills, I am well-equipped to handle complex technical challenges and deliver efficient solutions. My goal is to enhance operational effectiveness and maximize productivity in the IT environment.
