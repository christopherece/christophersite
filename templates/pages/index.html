                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Welcome to my resume site! I am a licensed electronics engineer with a primary focus on site support. However, my true passion lies in programming, server administration, and Linux.

                    As a dedicated site support professional, I have honed my skills in troubleshooting, maintaining, and optimizing various systems. I have a deep understanding of the technical aspects required to ensure smooth operations and resolve any issues that may arise.

                    Beyond my core responsibilities, I have a strong affinity for programming and possess expertise in languages such as Django, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I enjoy leveraging my programming skills to create innovative solutions and enhance user experiences.

                    Moreover, I have extensive experience in server administration, particularly with Linux systems. I am adept at managing server environments, implementing security measures, and optimizing performance to achieve efficient and reliable operations.

                    My ability to balance site support duties with my passion for programming, servers, and Linux allows me to bring a unique perspective to my work. I am driven by continuous learning and staying up to date with the latest industry trends to provide the best possible solutions.
