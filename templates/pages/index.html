                            He draws 5 smiley in the board and ask what rate (from 1 - 5) we gave it to him. 
                            THe site has an admin panel, which you can ad speaker names and their corresponding topics.
                            Also there is a Bar graph that will show the breakdown of all the rate.  <br>
