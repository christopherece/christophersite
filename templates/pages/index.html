                I design and deploy web applications with a focus on flexibility, performance, and local control. My tech stack includes Django for backend development, paired with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Materialize to create dynamic and responsive front-end interfaces.

                For deployment, I use Proxmox to virtualize and manage local servers, hosting on Ubuntu with Docker containers to ensure seamless application isolation. Postgres serves as the primary database, while Cloudflare provides reverse proxy services to enhance security and optimize traffic flow.
                
                In addition, I leverage Windows Server IIS for specific projects, utilizing both MSSQL and Postgres databases as required. By hosting locally, I maintain greater control over the environment, enabling robust, scalable, and secure application deployments.
