            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Greetings! <br>

                I am an experienced Technical Engineer with a strong background in IT support and over 10+ years of experience in the information technology and services industry. I excel in providing top-notch technical support for both hardware and software issues, both onsite and remotely. <br>
                In addition to my IT support skills, I have also knowledge in virtualization using Proxmox. I am proficient in setting up and managing virtual environments, optimizing resource allocation, and resolving virtualization challenges. <br>
                I also have hands-on experience with Docker. Leveraging Docker, I have improved development workflows, simplified application deployment, and ensured software portability across different environments. <br>
                Furthermore, I possess programming skills in Django, Laravel and JS, allowing me to develop custom solutions and automate tasks. I have used programming to create scripts, develop small-scale applications, and integrate Docker into larger software solutions. <br>
                With my expertise in IT support, virtualization using Proxmox, Docker experience, and programming skills, I am well-equipped to handle complex technical challenges and deliver efficient solutions. My goal is to enhance operational effectiveness and maximize productivity in the IT environment.

                My deployment process involves using Proxmox for virtualization, 
                Ubuntu server as the web server, Docker to containerize the applications, Postgres for the database
                and Cloudflare for reverse proxy. This approach allows me 
                to efficiently manage and deploy my web applications, ensuring reliability, scalability, and security.
