            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Greetings! <br>

                I am an experienced Technical Engineer with a strong background in IT support and over 10+ years of experience in the information technology and services industry. I excel in providing top-notch technical support for both hardware and software issues, both onsite and remotely. <br>
                Throughout my IT career, I have developed additional skills. I have acquired knowledge in virtualization using Proxmox, Ansible for configuring systems, deploy software and system updates to provide custom solutions and automate tasks. I also have hands-on experience with Docker. Leveraging Docker, I have improved development workflows, 
                simplified application deployment, and ensured software portability across different environments. <br>
                Furthermore, I possess programming skills in Django, Laravel and JS, combine with SQL Database allowing me to develop web applications. I have used programming to create scripts, develop small-scale applications, and integrate Docker into larger software solutions. <br>
                With my expertise in IT support, virtualization using Proxmox, Ansible, Docker experience, and programming skills, I am well-equipped to handle complex technical challenges and deliver efficient solutions. My goal is to enhance operational effectiveness and maximize productivity in the IT environment.

                My deployment process involves using Proxmox for virtualization,
